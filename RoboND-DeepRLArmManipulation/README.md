# Deep RL Arm Manipulation

This project is based on the Nvidia open source project "jetson-reinforcement" developed by [Dustin Franklin](https://github.com/dusty-nv). The goal of the project is to create a DQN agent and define reward functions to teach a robotic arm to carry out two primary objectives:

1. Have any part of the robot arm touch the object of interest, with at least a 90% accuracy.
2. Have only the gripper base of the robot arm touch the object, with at least a 80% accuracy.

The write-up report can be found [here](https://github.com/xUansen/RoboND-DeepRLArmManipulation/blob/master/writeup/Report__Deep_RL_Arm_Manipulation.pdf)

## Building from Source (Nvidia Jetson TX2)

Run the following commands from terminal to build the project from source:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ git clone http://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepRL-Project
$ cd RoboND-DeepRL-Project
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

During the `cmake` step, Torch will be installed so it can take awhile. It will download packages and ask you for your `sudo` password during the install.

## Project Environment

To get started with the project environment, run the following:

``` bash
$ cd RoboND-DeepRL-Project/build/aarch64/bin
$ chmod u+x gazebo-arm.sh
$ ./gazebo-arm.sh
```

The plugins which hook the learning into the simulation are located in the `gazebo/` directory of the repo. The RL agent and the reward functions are to be defined in [`ArmPlugin.cpp`](gazebo/ArmPlugin.cpp).
